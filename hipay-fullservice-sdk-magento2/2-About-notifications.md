### Payment Notifications

During payment workflow, order status is updated only with HiPay fullservice notifications.   
The endpoint of notification is `http://yourawesomewebsite.com/hipay/notify/index`.  
It is protected by a passphrase encrypted. So don't forget to enter it in your Magento and HiPay BO.  

For more informations, you can see the treatment in Model [Notify](src/Model/Notify.php).

### Transaction statues

All HiPay fullservice transactions statues are processed but not all them interact with Magento order statues.  
This treatment occure only when notification is received (see. Notification part).  

When a statut is processing we create a magento payment transaction.  
Else we just add a new order history record with notifications informations.  

HiPay fullservice statues interaction:

- *BLOCKED* (`110`) and *DENIED* (`111`)  
    Transaction type **"Denied"** is created:
    - Transaction is closed
    - If invoice in status *pending* exists, it's canceled
